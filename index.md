### Data Traffic
Elsa Wa-Bot encrypts all datas while sending messages, receiving messages, updates etc. There is no possible memory leaks.

### Changing Branchs on Local Installation
Elsa Wa-Bot uses always **main** branch. If users cloned other branches, they can't able to install it.

### My Bot is Very Slowly, What should I do?
Firstly, you can check your ethernet connection. Your ping, packet loss and bandwidth. WhatsAsena uses phone's ethernet connection (Wi-Fi, Li-Fi, Mobile). So This is not about the Elsa Wa-Bot, it's about the device or the internet used.

### Why Are Updates Coming Late?
Because I'm the only developer. I need to test every step. I need to check each branch and import it into unique npm package. And I have a social life too :)
